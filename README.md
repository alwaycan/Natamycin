# Natamycin
Introduction and latest development of natamycin. 关于纳他霉素的介绍和最新进展
Natamycin, as a pure natural food preservative, can form a complex with sterols to change the selective permeability of plasma membrane, resulting in the exosmosis of cellular nutrients and eventually death.
Natamycin treatment solution of 0.5-6.0 mg/kg can inhibit the main mold causing food spoilage. And yeast fungi are generally inhibited at 1.0~5.0 mg/kg natamycin concentration.
The solubility of natamycin in water and oil is extremely low, and even if a small amount of natamycin is ingested by the human body, it will be eliminated from the body in feces without causing any harmful effects on the human body.
